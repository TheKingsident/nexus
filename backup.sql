877	92060	Michael Jackson's Thriller	A night at the movies turns into a nightmare when Michael and his date are attacked by a horde of bloody-thirsty zombies. On top of the success of the Thriller album and Michael Jackson's electrifying performance at Motown 25, the short film/music video for "Thriller" established Jackson as an international superstar and global phenomenon. Thriller is credited for transforming music videos into a serious art form, breaking down racial barriers in popular entertainment, popularizing the making-of documentary format and creating a home video market. The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture. In 2009, it became the first music video inducted into the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant". "Thriller" was also Jackson's seventh and final U.S. Hot 100 Top 10 hit from the Thriller album. It was the first album in history to have seven U.S. Top 10s.	1983-11-14	/dYHGoPMkZMVuBA4EydmDQMo1EEv.jpg	/aVefEnQsfNPUrgsuMszTDt165P0.jpg	8.212	717	2025-08-11 13:43:31.486736+00	2025-08-16 08:48:05.213951+00
2067	1287717	Do Not Enter	Two working class youtubers ‘in the making’ enter an abandoned mansion to get their basketball back, and get lost inside while pranking each other. They record their ‘quick adventure’ with their phones for their audience, and tweak it with a fake phantom appearance to attract more followers to their YouTube channel. When uploaded the video goes viral, so they start a challenge: if the video reaches a certain number of views, they will enter the house again, at night, alone, totally unprotected. As fans react positively, they will do as promised, not only to discover and unveil the true nature of the place and their inhabitants, but to realize they might not be among the living anymore. Which opens a question - how far would you go to be famous?	2024-08-15	/1l6eDcH11b9aRmmd4a9WWwhVJ5T.jpg	/kNI01OBzgKmEXeWTIOsB2aVpVTw.jpg	6.9	144	2025-08-16 08:10:22.607184+00	2025-08-16 08:50:50.590177+00
1532	1299046	Diamonds	A film director gathers his favorite actresses, those he worked with and those he loved. He wants to make a film about women but he doesn’t reveal much: he observes them, takes cue, until his imaginary throw them into another era, in a past where the noise of the sewing machines fills a workplace handled and populated by women, where men have minor and marginal roles and cinema can be told from another point of view: the one of costume. Between loneliness, passions, anxieties, heartbreaking absence and unbreakable bonds, reality and fiction permeate, as well as the lives of the actresses and those of the characters, the competition and the sisterhood, the visible and the invisible.	2024-12-19	/l9Gwwr7nMQzCsOZ9B0b6FlOWTU6.jpg	/pbcKKVPlySkjr1oMCQyNKZBoI5A.jpg	7.216	255	2025-08-13 16:31:50.395662+00	2025-08-16 08:51:06.184496+00

2087	1319473	Feeling Better	A man spends peacefully his days in hospital without too many worries. He has been hospitalized for a while but that condition seems like the best way to live his life, safe from everything and everyone, without responsibilities and problems of any kind. It feels really good in there and even if some of his ward companions feel trapped, for them he can also feel free like nowhere else. That precious routine runs smoothly until a new person is admitted to the same ward. She is a restless, angry companion, she accepts nothing of that condition, especially the unwritten rules. She is not willing to wait, she wants to leave that place better or even worse. She wants to live as she should or die, as happens to those who end up in there. He is overwhelmed by that fury, first trying to defend himself and then accepting something incomprehensible. That encounter will help him accept that if you choose to truly face your heart and your emotions, there is no possible repair.	2025-03-27	/kkpQQBgWt27klMPasJMwvTc0vgH.jpg	/cEBNsPzPowJZvLnoyFvBuXQwN4a.jpg	6.2	33	2025-08-16 08:11:39.826984+00	2025-08-16 08:51:44.338598+00

2133	1411965	Robert Shields: My Life as a Robot	Award Winning Documentary on the Life of Artist Robert Shields.  “Robert Shields: My Life as a Robot” is a documentary that will make you believe that your actions can have an inspirational effect on so many lives - and you may not even be aware of it.  An icon of the 70’s, Robert began his career doing his robot in front of the Hollywood Wax Museum and a few short years later had his own top rated Prime Time CBS Variety show with his beautiful wife Lorene called: “The Shields & Yarnell Show”. And along the way, unbeknownst to him, he created ripples that define an art form to this day.  This film may not save the environment, it won’t take on a corrupt corporation nor will it make you write your congress person. What it will do is make you laugh, bring you wonder and joy and introduce you to a man who makes you believe that anything is possible… including (and don’t try this at home!) Street Skiing in downtown San Francisco!	2025-08-22	/lP0PlkxFxbD807TK9AmuqeEeXYd.jpg	/rZDXClhLPCQxP3LaIVJxXFrYb7V.jpg	0	0	2025-08-16 08:12:42.749821+00	2025-08-16 08:52:06.694009+00
